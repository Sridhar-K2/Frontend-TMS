Sure, here's a basic outline of how you could set up a task management application using MongoDB for data storage, along with routing, context/redux for state management, and a RESTful API for authentication and task management. We'll create a README file for this project.

# Task Management Application

This is a task management web application built with MongoDB, React (using Context/Redux for state management), and an Express.js RESTful API for server-side functionality.

## Features

- User registration and authentication (using JWT)
- CRUD operations for managing tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Responsive UI for task management
- Task categories and priorities
- Task filtering and sorting

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js (with React Router for routing), Context API/Redux for state management, Axios for HTTP requests
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB (with Mongoose for data modeling)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication
- **Styling**: CSS or styled-components for styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (with npm )
- MongoDB installed locally or via a cloud service (like MongoDB Atlas)



1. **Start the development servers**

```bash
cd frontend   # Navigate to the frontend folder
npm start     # Start the frontend development server

cd ../backend   # Navigate to the backend folder
npm start       # Start the backend development server
```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` and the backend on `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Routes

- `POST /api/signup` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/login` - Login user and receive JWT token
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get a single task by ID
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update a task by ID
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete a task by ID
